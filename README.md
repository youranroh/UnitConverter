# UnitConverter
A personal project to practice using JFrame and ActionListeners. 
I referenced google's unit converter and its conversion formulas to create the following project. 

First, you must set the base unit to convert from and to convert to.
The conversion options include: Length, Time, Temperature, Mass, and Volumn.

Second, you then choose the start unit and the end unit.
For example, if you chose the Length as your base unit to convert from and to convert to,
you must also set the "From" and "To": from meter to centimeters.
